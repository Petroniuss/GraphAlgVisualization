1. Add suitable navbar - view:
    - create play/pause button
    - add nested dropdowns
2. Implement communication serivce that would allow sending commands from navbar to plane.
3. Create some sort of model for managing simulation and graph on top of which algorithms could
    be implmeneted.
4. We need to map size of svg 

5. Each algorithm might have some sort of context menu associated with it
   For example if sb selects breadth-first-search he might wanna select multiple nodes 
   to start simulation

Extra bits:
    The communication between menu-navbar-whatever should be done via service
        and rxjs library :).

    We should support few type of events:
        - addNodes/addEdges 
        - set particular algorithm
        - run/pause
        - set some sort of view configuration (this one is optional)
            for example: speed of animation
