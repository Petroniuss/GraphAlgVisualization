1. Add suitable navbar - view
2. Implement communication serivce that would allow sending commands from navbar to plane.
3. Create some sort of model for managing simulation and graph on top of which algorithms could
    be implmeneted.

Extra bits:
    The communication between menu-navbar-whatever should be done via service
        and rxjs library :).

    We should support few type of events:
        - addNodes/addEdges 
        - set particular algorithm
        - run/pause
        - set some sort of view configuration (this one is optional)
            for example: speed of animation
